excerpt: '<SPAN STYLE="font-size: smaller">Historical languages are increasingly being modelled computationally. Syntactically annotated texts are often a sine-qua-non in their modelling, but parsing of pre-modern language varieties faces great data sparsity, intensified by high levels of orthographic variation. In this paper we present a good-quality Early Slavic dependency parser, attained via manipulation of modern Slavic data to resemble the orthography and morphosyntax of pre-modern varieties. The tool can be deployed to expand historical treebanks, which are crucial for data collection and quantification, and beneficial to downstream NLP tasks and historical text mining.</SPAN>'
