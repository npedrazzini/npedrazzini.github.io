excerpt: '<SPAN STYLE="font-size: smaller">We evaluate four count-based and predict-ive distributional semantic models of Ancient Greek against AGREE, a composite benchmark of human judgements, to assess their ability to retrieve semantic relatedness. On the basis of the observations deriving from the analysis of the results, we design a procedure for a larger-scale intrinsic evaluation of count-based and predictive language models, including syntactic embeddings. We also propose possible ways of exploiting the different layers of the whole AGREE benchmark (including both human-and machine-generated data) and different evaluation metrics.</SPAN>'
