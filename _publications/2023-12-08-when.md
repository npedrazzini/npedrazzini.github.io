permalink: /publication/2023-12-08-when
excerpt: '<SPAN STYLE="font-size: smaller">In this paper, we explore the semantic map of the English temporal connective <i>when</i> and its parallels in more than 1,000 languages drawn from a parallel corpus of New Testament translations. We show that there is robust evidence for a cross-linguistic distinction between <i>universal</i> and <i>existential</i> WHEN. We also see tentative evidence that innovation in this area involves recruiting new items for universal WHEN which gradually can take over the existential usage. Another possible distinction that we see is between serialized events, which tend to be expressed with non-lexified constructions and framing/backgrounding constructions, which favor an explicit subordinator.</SPAN>'
