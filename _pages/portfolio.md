## Linguistics

I mainly work in [historical linguistics](https://www.britannica.com/science/historical-linguistics) (Slavic and wider Indo-European). I like experimental and computational approaches and get bored very quickly when I do interpretative, close-reading work (which is my limit: I look up to traditional philologists). 

Some of the areas I work on are:
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>semantics of non-finite clauses</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>typology of temporal subordination</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>discourse representation theory</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>temporal semantics across sentences</li>
</ul>

I am also very fond of:
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>the history of Church Slavonic and of individual Slavic literary languages</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-sign-language"></i>the interaction between Church Slavonic and pre-modern Slavic vernaculars</li>
</ul>

<i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> My <a href="https://www.granduniondtp.ac.uk/people/nilo-pedrazzini">doctoral project</a> looks (mostly quantitatively, through treebank data) into the competition between finite and non-finite temporal subordinates in Early Slavic.

## Open Scholarship in the Humanities

I am Editorial Assistant for the Journal of Open Humanities Data ([JOHD](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com)) and Fellow at [RROx](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#NiloPedrazzini), the Oxford 'branch' of the UK Reproducibility Network ([UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org)). 

I'm interested in the specific challenges faced by the Humanities in making research reproducible (also: I get a bit angry when I am not given the steps followed by another researcher to get to an interpretation or a result). 

My main (still meagre!) contributions to the discussion are:
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code-branch"></i>a paper, written with <a href="https://www.unine.ch/isla/home/equipe/paola-marongiu.html">Paola Marongiu</a>, <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/marton-ribary">Marton Ribary</a> and <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/barbara-mcgillivray">Barbara McGillivray</a>, to be presented at DHNord <a href="https://www.meshs.fr/page/dhnord_2020"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> in November 2021, titled <i>Le Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD): enjeux et défis dans la publication de data papers pour les sciences humaines</i>. There we report some preliminary results obtained from the analysis of publication metrics on JOHD's data papers and attached public datasets, and the positive impact of the publication of Humanities data papers on the reuse of the datasets themselves (which cannot be but a good sign of research progress!).</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code-branch"></i>as part of my involvement with RROx, I've organized the <a href="https://openhumanitiesseminar.github.io">Open Humanities Seminar Series (OHSS)</a>, a monthly event running from January 2022, dedicated to different aspects of Open Humanities, including, but not limited to, reproducibility and replicability, qualitative preregistration, publishing open Humanities research, copyright issues and intellectual property rights in Open Humanities.</li>
</ul>

## Natural Language Processing

I really am interested in *all* aspects of NLP for historical languages, but so far I've mostly focussed on the following:

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-terminal"></i>Early Slavic dependency parsing (see OldSlavNet <a href="https://npedrazzini.github.io/OldSlavNet/"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and <a href="https://npedrazzini.github.io/publications/">Publications</a>).</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-terminal"></i>as my doctoral research has been drifting from syntax to semantics, I'm experimenting with distributional semantics for Ancient Greek and Early Slavic. I also integrate dependency information in my models ('syntactic word vectors'), some of which will hopefully be of good enough quality to be out soon: so watch this space!</li>
</ul>

## Digital Humanities

It's hard to set Digital Humanities apart from my main areas of research, and that's often true for digital humanists at large: one tends to approach DH to answer questions in their research areas, and then may find themselves wondering about DH tools and techniques as such. The following are some of the areas I work most frequently in:

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i>corpus building, treebanking</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i>digitizations, TEI-encoding</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i>handwritten text recognition</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i>DH website development</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i>linguistic data visualization</li>
</ul>

## Selected past projects
### ReadOxford
In 2020 I spent two months as a Research Assistant at the ReadOxford <a href="https://readoxford.org/our-research"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> research group, based at the Department of Experimental Psychology <a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> of the University of Oxford. The aim of the group is to answer different questions related to child literacy development.
I mainly dealt with data processing, developing R scripts to make corpus data reproducible and analysable for morphological complexity and lexical variation. My major contribution has been scripting an <a href="https://github.com/npedrazzini/averageReducedFrequency">R code</a> to automatically calculate the Average Reduced Frequency (ARF) of combined lemmata/parts of speech in the Oxford Children Corpus <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/oxford-childrens-corpus/"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and Childes <a href="https://childes.talkbank.org"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> treebank.

### IMCC
Starting from mid-2020, I was first Research Assistant <a href="https://imcc.web.ox.ac.uk/people/mr-nilo-pedrazzini"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, then collaborated with the International Multimodal Communication Centre (IMCC) <a href="https://imcc.web.ox.ac.uk"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> based within the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies (OSGA) at the University of Oxford. I carried out annotation and correlation analyses of speech-gesture co-occurrences in Russian and American media, largely within the project <i>Depictions of Post-COVID-19 Futures in Russian International Media: Multimodal Viewpoint Analysis</i> <a href="https://imcc.web.ox.ac.uk/projects"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. 

### British Library
In 2015, I spent two months as a trainee Assistant Curator-Cataloguer for the Slavonic Collections at The British Library <a href="https://www.bl.uk/subjects/slavonic-studies#"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. During that time, I enhanced the online catalogue of all Slavonic early-printed Cyrillic books held at the British Library (and fuelled my interest for all-things data and pre-modern Slavic). Check out two posts I wrote for the British Library's European Studies Blog:

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-paper-plane"></i><i> Fairytales on trial: the Good and the Beautiful in early-Soviet children’s literature</i> (26th March 2019) <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2019/03/fairytales-on-trial.html"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-paper-plane"></i><i> A reluctantly modern voice from the 17th-century Russian storm: Archpriest Avvakum and the Lifewritten by himself</i> (10 June 2015) <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2015/06/a-reluctantly-modern-voice-from-the-17th-century-russian-storm.html"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
