Hi! I'm a 2nd-year DPhil (aka PhD) student in Linguistics at the University of Oxford. 

On paper, I'm mostly researching Early ('Medieval') Slavic syntactic-semantic-discourse phenomena - in reality, I divide my time equally between my doctoral [project](https://npedrazzini/github.io/projects/) and getting my hands dirty with lots of [coding](https://npedrazzini/github.io/projects/) for not-always-related side projects. 

I have quite an obsession for automating everything in my work, which (not without reason) is sometimes a controversial practice in philologically-driven disciplines, like historical linguistics. 

Most of my side projects therefore deal in one way or the other with striking a balance between close- and distant-reading approaches to historical linguistics, between computational modeling and interpretation, between corpus-building and exploitation of existing corpora. 

My ultimate goal is to contribute to bridging the humanities and data science by proving how limited they are without one another. 


Yep, I know. Ugh, who do I think I am?
